abstract: "This paper reports methods and results from a participatory design workshop aimed at evaluating the use of speech synthesis and text-to-speech for Ojibwe language education. Using an existing text-to-speech feature as a starting point, we worked with two groups of Ojibwe language instructors using a guided trial of the speech synthesis system and a two hour semistructured workshop with the aim of creating a lesson plan that utilizes text-to-speech. We highlight the insights from this work, both in how to design and deliver speech synthesis systems for Indigenous language education, but also how to approach and design such a workshop to ensure a fruitful discourse."
